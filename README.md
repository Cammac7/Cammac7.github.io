This repository is for the Labor of Love that is my personal website.
Here is where I try to document work I've done that tends to be more broad than just github code of mine.
It also serves as my personal resume of sorts.

Finally, this is where I like to explore different front-end tricks as I learn them. As such, this website changes pretty frequenty.
Please check out the link to explore the site, or check out the code if so inclined.

## The Technical
I often get asked about the dots on the site. 
In a nutshell, it's done with two stacked HTML5 canvases. The lower canvas (invisible to the user), is white, and gets drawn on in black. The top canvas (where the dots are visible), traces the bottom one and draws colorful dots wherever there is black. This allows me to easily outline, write etc. Any drawing that is possible on an html5 canvas can now be done with fun interactive dots!
The code for this is in canvas.js

## The Outdated
There are a couple pieces I'm technically proud of that have since been removed from the site (but can still be looked at via github!)
1. When I had a smaller number of "Work" tiles, I built them with D3 into cool slotting triangles. Nothing too groundbreaking, but it was fun for me to learn D3.

2. I used to have an interactive Twitter bird that followed users around the page (animated and flapping it's wings) and then froze and shifted to reveal a link to my Twitter page when hovered over. The bird was distracting, and I have since moved on from Twitter, but the code for the bird is super freaking cool.
