          <p class="lead">MOLLY SMITH (Producer) produced her first film, “P.S. I Love You,” in 2006, with Wendy Finerman and Alcon Entertainment, which went on to gross over $150M worldwide. Following P.S., Smith had a first-look producing deal at Alcon Entertainment, during which Smith was the Executive Producer on the Oscar nominated hit “The Blind Side” (2009), and produced “Something Borrowed” (2011) and “Beautiful Creatures”(2013). 
<p class="lead">During that time, THAD LUCKINBILL (Producer) appeared on both the large and small screen, including a recurring role on “Nikita” and guest roles on major TV shows, including “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Law and Order: Criminal Intent,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” and “Nip/Tuck.” 
</p>
<p class="lead">His brother, TRENT LUCKINBILL (Producer) gained an extensive legal and financial background working in both the private and public sector's at the Department of Treasury’s Office of Financial Stability and as a lawyer at the Department of Justice in Washington D.C. In 2012, Trent moved to Los Angeles, and Smith decided to leave her producing deal at Alcon to partner with Trent and Thad Luckinbill to form Black Label Media, a new film finance and production company devoted to producing high quality commercial content. 
</p>
<p class="lead">After the company’s inception early in 2013, they produced “<a href="TheWork.html#thegoodlie">The Good Lie</a>”, inspired by true events, about a young refugee of the Sudanese Civil War who wins a lottery for relocation to the United States. The film stars Academy-Award winner Reese Witherspoon along with newcomers and Sudanese refugees Arnold Oceng, Emmanuel Jal and Ger Duany. Written by Margaret Nagle and directed by Academy Award nominee, Philippe Falardeau, the film is slated for release in October 2014 through Alcon Entertainment and Warner Brothers.  
</p>
<p class="lead">Black Label’s 2014 slate also includes, “<a href="TheWork.html#beginagain">Begin Again</a>” distributed by The Weinstein Co. in July 2014 , and “<a href="TheWork.html#71"> '71</a>” starring Jack O’Connell. The film was directed by Yann Demange and premiered at the Berlin Film Festival.  Roadside Attractions is distributing the film. Black Label Media is currenty in production on “Sicario,” which is being directed by Denis Villenueve (“Prisoners”) and starring Emily Blunt, Benecio Del Toro and Josh Brolin. The company is also in preproduction on “Demolition, which is Jean Marc Valle (“Dallas Buyer’s Club)’s next picture and stars Jake Gyllenhall and Naomi Watts. BLM’s active development slate includes “LIV,” “Bootlegger’s Boy,” “Salinger’s War,” which will be directed by Danny Strong, and “Others Unknown,” an adaptation of the book developed by Chris McQuarrie.

Molly, Thad and Trent all met and became great friends several years ago.  While in their respective careers they began devising a business plan in late 2011 to raise a film fund and start their own independent financing arm and production company.  They saw a shift in the industry around that time that the big studios were not making the mid-range budgeted films with A-list filmmakers and A-list talent.  They set out with a goal to develop relationships in the Independent side of the film business with various distributors, sales agents, finance agents and filmmakers.  In their two years of operation, they have put together an impressive filmmaker driven slate, with great talent in all ares.  The company remains small and intimate, as the three partners divide and conquer all aspects of producing and running a business.

"We are creative producers and business-minded, but most importantly we bond over a love of working together as close friends and have fun producing projects we are extremely passionate about.  Our goal is to make high-quality content and work with incredibly talented filmmakers on all fronts.  We have certainly learned a lot over the past few years and are continuing to learn as the business continues to change constantly.  We feel lucky to have surrounded ourselves with a small but amazing team of advisors as well that we enjoy working with and are helping us run our business in the most efficient way." </i><span style="color:#333333">—Molly Smith</span></p><br>
