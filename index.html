                                    <p style="text-align:left;">Invasion of the Energy Monsters is a project that I’ve been working on for two years now, first as work with a professor, and now as a free-time project.</p><br>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">The Game</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Energy Monsters started as an educational game where two teams (Human Heros and Energy Monsters) faced off in a “haunted” house composed of individual room tiles. Energy Monsters played cards to attack, or turn on appliances in rooms and grow stronger on the “wasted electricity”. Humans could then turn the same appliances off to save electricity and turn the tides in their favor before their own attacks.
The lab saw some commercial potential in the game and I was told:
“Well right now it’s pretty fun, but it’s not really fun”. <br>I set out to make it really  fun.</p><br>

                            <div class="col-md-8">

<h3 style="text-align:left;">The Rules</h3><p style="text-align:left;">I played Energy Monsters constantly, with every friend that I could recruit, and tweaked the rules. I gradually discovered that the game could be stalled out by either team, and there wasn’t enough speed to the game by having teams only play cards (often in far-away rooms) to shift the playing field. So, I implemented my first major rule change: when a monster entered the room, it automatically turned on the “lights” in that room and added 50 watts of wasted electricity. When a human entered a room, they automatically turned any “on” lights off, and reduced wattage by 50. <a href="media/rules_Cam.pdf">Read my first updated version of the rules here.</a>

This added chase element made the game much more exciting to play. Players always had a move they could make, even if it was just turning off or on some lights while they bided their time for a bigger play.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">The Problem</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">As with most things, with the new solution came a new problem. players were having to flip over multiples tiles every turn to signify that lights were on or off in specific rooms. This drastically slowed the game down and was annoying. Using tokens or the like to signify “lights on” was no better because it cluttered up the board. The new lights rule also meant that players had to be adding and subtracting small amounts of wattage to the spinner every turn, which was tedious. I set out to solve all of these problems.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">The Board</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">My idea was to build a board that the tiles would sit on. I wanted to use magnets in the pieces to trigger LEDs in the board to turn on or off depending on whether the piece was a monster or a human. I set off learning about circuits, an area I knew nothing about, and finally came to a solution. Using magnetic-field-sensing hall effect sensors connected to an arduino, and magnets in the playing pieces oriented towards different polarities, I was able to make pieces turn on and off lights in each room, and automatically track the change in wattage with the arduino. The feedback was instant and very satisfying.<br>

This process was a journey though. There aren’t enough pins in the Arduino to manage all of the sensors and lights on the 5x3 board. Once I managed my goal with just a couple rooms I had to learn about and implement multiplexors for the sensors. The LEDs needed different multiplexors because they need to hold their state even after the player’s magnetized piece moved to a different tile. Magnetizing the pieces themselves was also a challenge. I solved it by having the idea to 3d-print a hollow space into the token, drop the magnet in, and 3d-print the space closed.
Now the board tracks players paths as they move about, and dynamically updates the house wattage from the lights. I’m being published for my work with the board, and will be demoing it at the Games+Learning+Society Conference in Madison this August.

<h3 style="text-align:left;">The Future</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Another prototype is already underway that will add wifi connectivity to the board. After that, I plan on approaching a way to track the use and play of the cards themselves. Using an RFID reader and an antennae array, I hope to identify individual pieces (by adding RFID chips to them) and where they are on the board when at rest. Because RFID takes a few seconds, the hall-effect systems will still be needed to track movement. I will also add RFID chips to the cards themselves, and create a discard section of the board where cards are played. This way, when a person plays a card, the board itself will be able to determine where the respective piece is, and if the play is legal. If it is, the board will be able to alter the wattage accordingly on the house. In this way, all of the wattage tracking will be taken care of automatically and digitally, and the players can focus on the fun of the game, and still get the satisfaction of spinning a real spinner, rolling real die, and moving real pieces. This connection of digital convenience with physical feedback and motion is where I think all boardgame design is destined to end up.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: left;">As a way to explore Unity game design, two friends and I made a scrolling computer game called Bubble Turtle Adventure. I ended up becoming much more interested in designing sprite sheets and characters in Adobe Flash for the game, as well as writing and recording the music.<br>
                                        The game features a cute turtle in a desolate wasteland. Because the game is intended to poke fun at itself, I recorded all of the music and effects with only my voice (playing off of the opening menu scene in "Halo"). It was as hilarious as I had hoped.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">Pianimals was a project done with a few friends to explore computer vision systems and how they could be used to create new kinds of interaction.<br><br>

                            <h3 style="text-align:left;">Prototype One</h3><p style="text-align:left;">Our first prototype was a camera above a full keyboard that simply videotaped the user’s hands and displayed them in landscape under sheet music on an iPad. It also lit up on the sheet music what the next note to be played was. The goal was to prevent people from having to look back and forth from their hands to the sheet music as they learned. We were able to prototype this in incredibly low fidelity by holding a webcam above user’s hands and connecting the keyboard to an app called Synthesia.<br>

                            We quickly leaned from this that users didn’t care much about being able to see their hands, and focused much more on the visual feedback from the notes they were playing, and the notes to come on the music staff.</p><br><br>

                            <h3 style="text-align:left;">Prototypes Two and Three</h3><p style="text-align:left;">
                            We pivoted to a younger user population and focused on imparting an understanding of intervals and relative pitch instead of strict sight-reading. After a third prototype that added a learn-a-song mode, users began to give a lot of positive feedback, and research showed that a system like this could be very effective in teaching children some of the foundations of music.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">In the beginning of my Sophomore year I started taking on paid website development projects. Aaron Packman is an Environmental Engineering professor, and his lab studies the environmental impacts of many facets of human life. Environmental sustainability has always been a passion of mine, so I happily took on the project. I've managed and continually updated and revised the website for the past few years. <br>Not every design choice is one I would have made were the website my own, but taking on this long-term project has given me a lot of experience in balancing the free reign I've had with design and creation with the specific choices and changes that the client wanted.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Because I managed the relationship and the needs of Packman labs so well, Professor Packman recommended me to the university to build the website for the new Water Research Center, which I did as well.</p><br>
                            <p>I've also built websites for production companies, student groups, startups, and more!</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">In winter of 2015 I co-founded a startup called BabyNinja. We learned that pediatricians require parents to track information about a baby's feeding, sleeping, and bowel movements. Seeing the need, we created an iPhone and Apple Watch app (right before the Apple Watch was released) that allowed parents to track all of these with only two taps on their Apple Watch.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: left;">Being a co-founder forced me to wear many different hats in the interaction design process. I conducted over a hundred interviews with new parents, pediatricians, and baby experts. I made and sent out marketing materials and press releases, and tweeted. I also built our website, made many decisions on app design, and designed and built our database.<br><br>Founding a startup was exhausting, but it gave me invaluable experience in the full interaction design process, from research, to user testing, to backend and frontend develelopment and final product.(And then more user testing!)</p><br>
